# Rover Agenda - The #1 App for EAHS Students

## Addressing the prompt
This year's prompt for the FBLA Mobile Application Development event was to create an app that would
allow students to manage their school activities using a variety of features, including:
- A schedule
- A lunch menu
- A teachers list
- An extracurriculars page
- A calendar
- A bug reporting system

That's what our app, Rover Agenda, is here for. This app brings all of your school concerns into
one easy-to-access place. With a customizable schedule, a lunch menu, a list for emailing teachers,
a list of extracurriculars, a school event calendar, and a bug reporting system, you can keep track of
everything you need to know. Each part of the app is customized to your individual needs, with data
stored within your unique student account. No longer do you have to have several different apps to
keep track of everything; with Rover Agenda, you can be sure to keep track of everything in your busy
high school experience.

## Features
    - Custom Schedule
    - Weekly Lunch Menu
    - Teachers List
    - Built-in Email Form
    - Extracurricular Information
