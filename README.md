# Rover Agenda - The #1 App for EAHS Students

As a student of Easton Area High School, there are a lot of things for you to keep track of:
classes, extracurriculars, school events, teachers, and so much more. With all that in mind,
wouldn't it be so much easier if you could manage all of those things in one place?

That's what our app, Rover Agenda, is here for. This app brings all of your school concerns into
one easy-to-access place. With an included schedule, teachers list, school calendar, lunch menu,
